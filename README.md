## Welcome to my blog.

The year 2020 is about to start. I have written a thing in 5years.
I'm kicking off this blog with multiple goals in mind.

 - Improve my writting skills (noted that French is my native languages, I spent 8 years in Austin, Texas).
 - Keep track of my current thinkings. It's kind of fun to read your craft after a few years ago.
 - Connecting the dots in time and space.

Introduction
--- 
Well, I borned in Lyon in 1985. I spend years writting software for fun then make it full time well paid real job. I did initially study electronic from high school to preparatory school / graduate degree, then I finish with a master in semiconductor. Started my carreer in high profile hardware/software company named Arm. 
I moved to USA looking for interesting work and more future proof thinking. 10years later I'm still working from the same company. I will explore all topics like politic, future, technology, financing... 

 - **2013** I met my wife in Texas.
 - **2017** is the year where my daughter was borned. The following 2years were busy between my new job of dad and my existing job of software developer / design automation.
